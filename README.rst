Wavetrace
*************
Wavetrace is a Python 3.5 package designed to produce radio signal coverage reports, such as GeoTIFF files of signal strength contours,

given radio transmitter data and topography data around the transmitters.
It uses `SPLAT! <http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html>`_ to predict the attenuation of radio signals, which implements a `Longley-Rice model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longley%E2%80%93Rice_model>`_.

Wavetrace can also compute line-of-site maps for geostationary satellites:

Wavetrace is intended for use in New Zealand but can be configured to work elsewhere on Earth. 
 

Installation
============
1. Install SPLAT! >= 1.4.0, GDAL >= 1.11, and ImageMagick. For example, to install these on a Linux system do ``sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install splat gdal-bin python-gdal imagemagick``
2. Create a Python 3.5 virtual environment
3. In your virtual environment, install Wavetrace via Pip via ``pip install wavetrace``


Usage
=========
Here is a common workflow for computing radio signal coverage reports for terrestrial transmitters.

#. Create a CSV file containing transmitter data; see ``tests/data/transmitters.csv``
#. Process the transmitter data into SPLAT! files via the function ``wavetrace.main.process_transmitters``
#. Download topography data around the transmitters via the functions ``wavetrace.main.compute_tiles`` and ``wavetrace.main.download_topography``.  Topography data comes in two flavors: SRTM3 (standard definition; 3 arc second resolution; roughly 66 meters at 45 degrees south latitude) or SRTM1 (high definition; 1 arc second resolution; roughly 22 meters at 45 degrees south latitude). SPLAT! can only handle those two formats.
#. Process the topography data into SPLAT! files via the function ``wavetrace.main.process_topography``
#. Compute signal coverage reports, which include GeoTIFF signal strength contour maps, from the processed transmitter and topography data via the function ``wavetrace.main.compute_coverage``

See the IPython notebook ``ipynb/examples.ipynb`` for a detailed example.

Additionally, you can call the most useful functions in the module ``wavetrace.main`` through Wavey, a command line interface for Wavetrace implemented in the module ``wavetrace.cli``.

Changelog
==========

v4.0.0, 2017-01-17
-------------------
- Removed Gitlab API key option, because it is unnecessary for accessing the required public repository
- Added the option to create ESRI Shapefiles in the functions ``main.compute_coverage`` and ``main.compute_satellite_los``.


v3.0.1, 2016-12-15
-------------------
- Repackaged with setuptools and ensured that the README is included in tar archive this time


v3.0.0, 2016-08-22
-------------------
- Added functions to compute line-of-sight for geostationary satellites
- Renamed some functions, hence the version bump


v2.0.0, 2016-08-22
-------------------
- Complete refactor and conversion into a Python package


v1.0.0, 2013
--------------
- Initial version
